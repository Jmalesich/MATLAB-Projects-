# MATLAB-Projects-
Some of the MATLAB projects used in Mechanical Engineering. Mainly this code takes from projects I needed to write in Numerical methods. This inlcudes using the taylor series. differentiating using simpsons and trapezoidal rule. Utilization of finite difference. Solving matricies to reduced row echelon form using Guass-Jordan elimination. And solving a second order ODE with a combination of the above methods.
